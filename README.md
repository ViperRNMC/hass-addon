## About

My Home Assistant repository provides you a way to add additional capabilites
to your Home Assistant installation by adding add-ons that provide additional
functionality.

This is only 1 such example of a Home Assistant repository and there are many
others including the [Home Assistant Community Add-ons][repositoryCommunity] project.

## Installation

This add-on isn't included in Home Assistant by default and needs to be added from a GitHub repository. Don't worry - the process isn't too hard!

1. Within Home Assistant, navigate to **Configuration** > ** Add-ons, Backups & Supervisor** 
1. Click **ADD-ON STORE** > **Menu** (3 dot elipsis, top right) > **Repositories**
1. Add the following Repository

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.
